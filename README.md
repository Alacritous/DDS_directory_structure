# DDS_directory_structure
Empty Directory structure based on 2018 version of Dewey Decimal System

The .rar file has the directory structure complete. 
The .py file is the program I made to create the directory structure. 
The 3 csv files contain the 3 heirarchical levels of the DDS structure that the .py script uses to create the directory structure. 

Just easier than copy name/create directory/paste name/change directory repeat. 

No warranty expressed or implied. I make no claim to any ownership of category names or structure. 
I make no claims as to the usability or functionality of anything you find here. 

There is no Santa Claus.
